🚀 Welcome to my GitHub repository! I'm Subhash, an Aerospace graduate with a passion for exploring the wonders of the cosmos. Currently, I bring my knowledge to life as a space science educator at Genex Space, where I've spent insightful 6 months sharing the excitement of space exploration.

🔭 Expertise: 
My professional journey has equipped me with a solid foundation in aerospace concepts, and I'm always eager to delve deeper into the mysteries of the universe. From rocket science to celestial mechanics, I thrive on pushing the boundaries of knowledge.

👨‍🏫 Teaching Experience:
Having spent time educating and inspiring others at Genex Space, I am dedicated to fostering a love for science and space exploration. Feel free to explore any educational projects or contributions I've made to enhance learning in these fascinating fields.

🏏🎲 Hobbies:
Beyond the world of aerospace, I find joy in the strategic moves of both cricket and chess. These games, much like the laws of physics, challenge the mind and keep me engaged in the pursuit of excellence.

📚🎨 Personal Interests:
Outside of the professional realm, you'll find me immersed in the pages of a good book or expressing creativity through drawing. Researching various topics keeps my mind inquisitive and open to new possibilities.

Feel free to explore my repositories and join me on this journey of exploration, education, and personal growth. Let's reach for the stars together! 🌌✨
